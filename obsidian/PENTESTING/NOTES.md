>Pre-Engagement
Some rules of engagement questions:
1. How many pages does a web application have?
2. How many user inputs or forms does the web application have?
3. What is the purpose and goal of the penetration test?
4. What is the size of your external/internal network?
> Information Gathering : Seasoned professionals normally spend a day or two conducting extensive reconnaissance on their target. The more knowledge that is known about the target will help the penetration tester to identify the attack surface such as points of entry in the target's systems and networks. Additionally, this phase also helps the penetration tester to identify the employees, infrastructure, geolocation for physical access, network details,
servers, and other valuable information about the target organization.

> THREAT MODELING : The following are some threat modeling frameworks:
• Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of server and Elevation of privilege (STRIDE)
• Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA).

> VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS: Vulnerability analysis typically involves the assessors or penetration testers running vulnerability or network/port scans to better understand which services are on the
network or the applications running on a system and whether there are any vulnerabilities
in any systems included in the scope of the assessment. This process often includes
manual vulnerability discovery and testing, which is often the most accurate form of
vulnerability analysis or vulnerability assessment.

> EXPLOITATION : To put it simply, during the information gathering phase, a penetration tester will profile the target and identify any vulnerabilities. Next, using the information about the vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will do their research and create specific exploits that will take advantage of the vulnerabilities of the target—this is exploitation. We use exploits (malicious code) to leverage a vulnerability (weakness) in a system, which will allow us to execute arbitrary code and commands on the target.

***HACKING PHASES***
Reconnaisance / Information Gathering -> Scanning & Enumeration -> Gaining Access -> Maintaining Access -> Covering Tracks.

>I**INFORMATION GATHERING PHASE**:
The following are techniques used in the reconnaissance phase:
• Using search engines to gather information
*Domain name searches / WHOIS lookups
*Internet Footprinting - emai address, usernames, social networks
*Internal Footprinting - Ping sweeps,port scanning, reverse DNS, packet sniffing
*OSINT
• Using social networking platforms
• Performing Google hacking/dorking
• Performing Domain Name System (DNS) interrogation
• Using social engineering
>| **SCANNING & ENUMERATION**
This is a more direct approach in engaging the target to obtain information that is not accessible via the reconnaisance phase.
The following are techniques used in the scanning phase:
• Checking for any live systems
• Checking for firewalls and their rules
• Checking for open network ports
• Checking for running services
• Checking for security vulnerabilities using vulnearbility scanners such as Nessus.
• Creating a network topology of the target network.

> **GAINING ACCESS**
The following can occur once access is gained:
• Password cracking
• Exploiting vulnerabilities
• Escalating privileges
• Hiding files

>**MAINTAINING ACCESS**
This is done by creating backdoor access to the target and setting up multiple persistence connections between the attacker's machines and the victim's system.
The objectives of maintaining access are as follows:
• Lateral movement
• Exfiltration of data
• Creating backdoor and persistent connections
Maintaining access is important to ensure that you, the penetration tester, always have access to the target system or network. Once the technical aspect of the penetration test is completed, it's time to clean up the network

>**COVERING YOUR TRACKS**
This ensures you do not leave traces of your presence on a compromised system or network.

**CYBER KILL CHAIN**
Developed by Lockheed Martin, the cyber kill chain describes the stages commonly followed by cyber attacks and security defenders can use the framework as part of intelligence-driven defence.

There are seven stages outlined by the Cyber Kill Chain, enhancing visibility and understanding of an adversary’s tactics, techniques and procedures.
The stages include:
>Recon -> Weaponization -> Delivery -> Exploitation -> Installation -> Command & Control -> Actions on Objectives.
