SECURITY FRAMEWORKS 
1. NIST CYbersecurity Framework
2. ISO 27000 Series
3. MITRE ATT&CK Framework

CYBER KILL CHAIN
Developed by Lockheed Martin, the cyber kill chain describes the stages commonly followed by cyber attacks and security defenders can use the framework as part of intelligence-driven defence.

There are seven stages outlined by the Cyber Kill Chain, enhancing visibility and understanding of an adversary’s tactics, techniques and procedures.
The stages include:
>Recon -> Weaponization -> Delivery -> Exploitation -> Installation -> Command & Control -> Actions on Objectives.

UNIFIED KILL CHAIN
The Unified Kill Chain can be described as the unification of the MITRE ATT&CK and Cyber Kill Chain frameworks. Published by Paul Pols in 2017 (and reviewed in 2022), the UKC provides a model to defend against cyber attacks from the adversary’s perspective. The UKC offers security teams a blueprint for analysing and comparing threat intelligence concerning the adversarial mode of working.
